= Description =

Process data is suppose to contain the processing of GPC and the dynamic data needed for the print_response.

Remember to call process_mode() inside it if you expect a {$_REQUEST['mode']}

The reason process_mode() is not automated is that it is still debate-able if it should be called before or after the default actions.
