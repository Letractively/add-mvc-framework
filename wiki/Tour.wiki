= Pages/Resources =

== Controllers ==
Pages are created through controllers. It is stored inside classes/ folder of the application.

Controllers are classes that represents the page/resource. execute() ( formerly page() ) are called on this functions which calls process_data() ( formerly process() ) and print_response().

on the _main execution file_ (eg. add.php) add::current_controller() is called and it's execute() function. add::current_controller() returns the instance of the current controller according to the current url path.

== Views ==
after process_data(), controllers call the function print_response().

== Accessing The Database ==
Accessing database in ADD MVC is done by models, models, in ADD MVC framework represent a table from the database. For example we have a table named "companies"

{{{
/**
 * model of company table
 */
CLASS company EXTENDS model_rwd {
   /**
    * the table of this model
    */
   const TABLE = 'companies';

   /**
    * the primary key of this model
    */
   const TABLE_PK = 'company_id';
}
}}}

model_rwd contains loads of functions for manipulating data from the database.

for example, for getting all the rows from the database (or SELECT `*` )
{{{

$companies = company::get_all();

foreach ($companies as $company) {
   echo "$company->company_name"; # print the company_name field
}

}}}
