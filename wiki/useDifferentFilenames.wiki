= Use Different FileNames =
You can also use your own filenames aside from listed on [gettingStarted] aside from .htaccess of course.

==Renamable files examples==
   # Config file (config.php)
   # Main execution file (add.php)
   # ADD Configure file (add_configure.php)
   # Includes directory
   # Assets directory

===Config file===
   You can do this by simply renaming the require()d file on _main execution file_ (add.php) or the _ADD Configure file_

example:

{{{
<?php

# Config file: settings.php
require 'settings.php';

# Require the add mvc framework's init.php
require 'includes/frameworks/add/init.php';

# Execute the automatically detected controller
add::current_controller()->execute();
?>
}}}

===Main Execution File===
   You can use different file name for the main execution file by editing .htaccess rewrites, say you want to use "add-execute.php" instead:

.htaccess:
{{{
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ add-execute.php?add_mvc_path=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
RewriteRule ^$ add-execute.php?add_mvc_path=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
}}}
